            <p>Born and raised in Ribeirão Preto, a city in the interior of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. I have been studying the technology area since 2014, where I started a technical IT course, where I learned about the concepts of most stacks, from front-end to hardware maintenance. I studied computer science at Unip College for 2 years, and I am currently studying analysis and development at the public college FATEC. When I have some time I have some hobbies, such as playing the guitar, I like playing strategy and competitive games, I also dabble in the kitchen, and I dare to say that I am the best cook in my house.</p>
