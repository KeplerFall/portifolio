            <p>Born and raised in Ribeirão Preto, a city in the interior of São Paulo, Brazil, I've been passionate about technology since 2014 when I began a technical IT course. This early exposure gave me a solid foundation in various stacks, ranging from front-end development to hardware maintenance. I studied Computer Science at Unip for two years, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC, a public institution.
            <br />
            In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, engaging in strategy and competitive games, and experimenting in the kitchen—where I proudly hold the title of the best cook in my household.</p>
